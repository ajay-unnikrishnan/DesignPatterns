# Builder pattern

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. 
It provides a way to construct an object step by step and allows the same construction process to create different representations of the object.

In the given code, the Builder pattern is implemented to construct a Car object. The pattern consists of the following key components:

1. Product (Car): Represents the object being built. It has properties such as Make, Color, and ManufactureDate.

2. Builder (ICarBuilder): Defines the interface for building the product. It provides methods like SetMake(), SetColor(), and SetManufactureDate() to set the various attributes of the Car object. The Build() method is used to retrieve the constructed Car object.

3. Concrete Builder (CarBuilder): Implements the ICarBuilder interface. It is responsible for constructing and assembling the parts of the Car object. The CarBuilder class maintains an instance of the Car object and sets its properties according to the methods called.

4. Director (Director): Controls the construction process using a builder object. In the code, the Director class creates an instance of CarBuilder and uses it to construct a Car object step by step. This allows for flexibility in constructing different variations of the Car object by changing the director or builder.

The Builder pattern provides a clean and flexible way to construct complex objects, especially when there are multiple steps involved and different representations are required. It promotes separation of concerns and improves the readability and maintainability of the code.
